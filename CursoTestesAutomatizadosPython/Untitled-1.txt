Some information about him:

I used the Python programming language.

I tried to demonstrate some knowledge that I believe are important in everyday life, such as object orientation, class decoupling, design patterns and hashmaps to locate information with linear computational cost.

At my github profile I have some personal projects that I believe also describe some personal interests such as computer vision.
